# The Voronizer

!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF OCTOBER

The Voronizer is a python script written to generate support structures and infill structures for 3D models.  The structures are based on Voronoi foam, and allow the user a lot of control over the resulting model.
